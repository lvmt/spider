Swimmer's Shoulder: Painful Shoulder in the Competitive Swimmer	27355281	Swimmer's shoulder is a broad term often used to diagnose shoulder injury in swimmers. However, research has elucidated several specific shoulder injuries that often are incurred by the competitive swimmer. Hyperlaxity, scapular dyskinesis, subacromial impingement, labral damage, os acromiale, suprascapular nerve entrapment, and glenohumeral rotational imbalances all may be included within a differential diagnosis for shoulder pain in the competitive swimmer. An understanding of the mechanics of the swim stroke, in combination with the complex static and dynamic properties of the shoulder, is essential to the comprehension and identification of the painful swimmer's shoulder. It is important for the athlete, coach, and clinician to be aware of the discerning characteristics among these different injuries to ensure a proper diagnosis and treatment plan to aid the swimmer in his or her return to competition.
Transcriptomic analysis of purified human cortical microglia reveals age-associated changes	28671693	Microglia are essential for CNS homeostasis and innate neuroimmune function, and play important roles in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Here we present gene expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. Overall, genes expressed by human microglia were similar to those in mouse, including established microglial genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and ITGAM (CD11B). However, a number of immune genes, not identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed in human microglia, including TLR, Fc¦Ã and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression and actin (dis)assembly. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently.
Targeting microglia for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease	27100611	While histological changes in microglia have long been recognized as a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent genetic association studies have also strongly implicated microglia in the etiology of the disease. Coding and noncoding polymorphisms in several genes expressed in microglia-including APOE, TREM2, CD33, GRN, and IL1RAP-alter AD risk, and therefore could be considered as entry points for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, microglia may have a substantial effect on current amyloid ¦Â (A¦Â) and tau immunotherapy approaches, since they are the primary cell type in the brain to mediate Fc receptor-facilitated antibody effector function. In this review, we discuss the considerations in selecting microglial therapeutic targets from the perspective of drug discovery feasibility, and consider the role of microglia in ongoing immunotherapy clinical strategies.

Induction of a common microglia gene expression signature by aging and neurodegenerative conditions: a co-expression meta-analysis	26001565	Introduction: Microglia are tissue macrophages of the central nervous system that monitor brain homeostasis and react upon neuronal damage and stress. Aging and neurodegeneration induce a hypersensitive, pro-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as primed microglia. To determine the gene expression signature of priming, the transcriptomes of microglia in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models were compared using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).Results: A highly consistent consensus transcriptional profile of up-regulated genes was identified, which prominently differed from the acute inflammatory gene network induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Where the acute inflammatory network was significantly enriched for NF-¦ÊB signaling, the primed microglia profile contained key features related to phagosome, lysosome, antigen presentation, and AD signaling. In addition, specific signatures for aging, AD, and ALS were identified.Conclusion: Microglia priming induces a highly conserved transcriptional signature with aging- and disease-specific aspects.
Critical data-based re-evaluation of minocycline as a putative specific microglia inhibitor	27246804	Minocycline, a second generation broad-spectrum antibiotic, has been frequently postulated to be a "microglia inhibitor." A considerable number of publications have used minocycline as a tool and concluded, after achieving a pharmacological effect, that the effect must be due to "inhibition" of microglia. It is, however, unclear how this "inhibition" is achieved at the molecular and cellular levels. Here, we weigh the evidence whether minocycline is indeed a bona fide microglia inhibitor and discuss how data generated with minocycline should be interpreted.

Passive immunization with phospho-tau antibodies reduces tau pathology and functional deficits in two distinct mouse tauopathy models	25933020	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), an extensive accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles, along with neuronal loss, is evident in distinct brain regions. Staging of tau pathology by postmortem analysis of AD subjects suggests a sequence of initiation and subsequent spread of neurofibrillary tau tangles along defined brain anatomical pathways. Further, the severity of cognitive deficits correlates with the degree and extent of tau pathology. In this study, we demonstrate that phospho-tau (p-tau) antibodies, PHF6 and PHF13, can prevent the induction of tau pathology in primary neuron cultures. The impact of passive immunotherapy on the formation and spread of tau pathology, as well as functional deficits, was subsequently evaluated with these antibodies in two distinct transgenic mouse tauopathy models. The rTg4510 transgenic mouse is characterized by inducible over-expression of P301L mutant tau, and exhibits robust age-dependent brain tau pathology. Systemic treatment with PHF6 and PHF13 from 3 to 6 months of age led to a significant decline in brain and CSF p-tau levels. In a second model, injection of preformed tau fibrils (PFFs) comprised of recombinant tau protein encompassing the microtubule-repeat domains into the cortex and hippocampus of young P301S mutant tau over-expressing mice (PS19) led to robust tau pathology on the ipsilateral side with evidence of spread to distant sites, including the contralateral hippocampus and bilateral entorhinal cortex 4 weeks post-injection. Systemic treatment with PHF13 led to a significant decline in the spread of tau pathology in this model. The reduction in tau species after p-tau antibody treatment was associated with an improvement in novel-object recognition memory test in both models. These studies provide evidence supporting the use of tau immunotherapy as a potential treatment option for AD and other tauopathies.
More Than Meets the Eye: The Effect of Intercanthal Distance on Perception of Beauty and Personality	29068970	In judging normalcy, surgeons rely on established facial anthropometric measures and proportions. However, there exists a range of "normal," and a degree of disproportion may be considered more attractive. The authors set out to determine how changes in only intercanthal distance affect the layperson's perception of beauty and personality traits of a face. The authors used Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing tool, to determine how changes in intercanthal distance affect overall perception of beauty and personality. MTurk respondents provided demographic information and were asked to survey 16 female subjects, each digitally edited to be hypoteloric or hyperteloric. Data were collected from 490 MTurk crowd raters. Paired t test analysis found that respondents perceived subjects to be more submissive, friendly, and attractive with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). Women respondents were less likely to perceive change in regards to how unthreatening and how intelligent the subject appeared upon intercanthal widening (P < 0.05). Compared with Caucasian respondents, minorities (Asian- and African-American) were more likely to perceive difference in submissiveness, threat, intelligence, and attractiveness with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). All respondents >46 years of age were less likely to perceive a change in any of the 7 traits upon intercanthal widening, compared with respondents between 18 and 25 years of age (P < 0.05). The layperson perceives significant increases in a female subject's submissivness, friendliness, and attractiveness with an intercanthal distance increase of 10% from normal. Surgeons should be aware of this when correcting hypertelorism, given the potential positive impact of a slightly increased intercanthal distance on perceived beauty and personality.
Quality of Life in Adults with Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis	29579020	Background: Although studies have analyzed quality of life in children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, to date nobody has investigated long-term quality of life in adults with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life in adult nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients with a cohort of unaffected controls.Methods: The authors queried their institution's prospectively maintained craniofacial registry for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients aged 18 years and older, and administered the validated World Health Organization Quality of Life Biomedical Research and Education Foundation questionnaire. Responses were compared, using a two-sample t test, to an age-matched U.S. normative database provided by the World Health Organization.Results: One hundred fifty-one adults met inclusion criteria: 52 were successfully contacted and 32 completed the questionnaire. Average age of respondents was 23.0 ¡À 6.1 years (range, 18.1 to 42.1 years). Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients had a superior quality of life compared with comparative norms in all domains: physical health (17.8 ¡À 2.7 versus 15.5 ¡À 3.2; p < 0.001), psychological (16.3 ¡À 2.9 versus 13.8 ¡À 3.2; p < 0.001), social (16.9 ¡À 2.6 versus 13.2 ¡À 3.6; p < 0.001), and environmental (17.2 ¡À 2.5 versus 11.7 ¡À 2.7; p < 0.001). Comparison between single-suture subtypes revealed no difference in any quality-of-life domain (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Adult patients previously treated for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis perceive their quality of life to be high, superior to that of a normative U.S.Sample: Future work will seek to analyze additional patients and better understand the reasons behind these findings.
Cleft-Palate Repair: Does Hospital Case-Volume Impact Outcomes or Cost?	29351184	Background: How hospital case-volume affects operative outcomes and cost continues to grow in importance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of case volume with operative outcomes and cost in cleft palate repair.Methods: Subjects undergoing cleft palate repair between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the Pediatric Health Information System. Outcomes were compared between two groups: those undergoing treatment at a high-volume institution, and those undergoing treatment at a low-volume institution. Primary outcomes were as follows: any complication, prolonged length of stay, and increased total cost.Results: Over 20,000 patients (n = 20,320) from 49 institutions met inclusion criteria. On univariate analysis, those subjects who underwent treatment at a high-volume institution had a lower rate of overall complications (3.4 percent versus 5.1 percent; p < 0.001), and lower rates of prolonged length of stay (4.5 percent versus 5.8 percent; p < 0.001) and increased total cost (48.6 percent versus 50.9 percent; p = 0.002). In multivariate regression analyses, subjects treated in high-volume centers were less likely to experience any complication (OR, 0.678; p < 0.001) and were less likely to have an extended length of stay (OR, 0.82; p = 0.005). Subjects undergoing palate repair at a high-volume institution were no less likely to incur increased total cost (OR, 1.01; p = 0.805).Conclusion: In institutions performing a high volume of cleft palate repairs, subjects had significantly decreased odds of experiencing a complication or prolonged length of stay.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.
Incidence of Cranial Base Suture Fusion in Infants with Craniosynostosis	29595734	Background: Cranial base sutures are important drivers of both facial and cranial growth. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence and location of cranial base suture fusion among three groups: nonaffected controls, patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.Methods: Patients and computed tomographic scans were accrued from the authors' prospective craniofacial database. Computed tomographic scans were graded on the frequency of cranial vault and cranial base suture/synchondrosis fusion (0, open; 1, partially/completely fused) by an attending craniofacial surgeon and neuroradiologist. Statistical comparisons were conducted on location and rates of fusion, age, and diagnosis.Results: One hundred forty patients met inclusion criteria: 55 syndromic, 64 nonsyndromic, and 21 controls. Average age at computed tomography of syndromic patients (3.6 ¡À 3.1 months) was younger than that of nonsyndromic patients (5.4 ¡À 3.1 months; p = 0.001) and control subjects (5.1 ¡À 3.2 months; p = 0.058). Syndromic craniosynostotic patients had over three times as many cranial base minor sutures fused (2.2 ¡À 2.5) as nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients (0.7 ¡À 1.2; p < 0.001) and controls (0.4 ¡À 0.8; p = 0.002), whose rates of fusion were statistically equivalent (p = 0.342). Syndromic craniosynostosis patients had a greater frequency of cranial base suture fusion in the coronal branches, squamosal arch, and posterior intraoccipital synchondrosis (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis have higher rates of cranial base suture fusion in infancy, especially in the coronal arches, and this may have significant implications for both cranial and facial growth. In contrast, patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis have similar rates and sites of cranial base suture fusion as controls. Interestingly, there is a low, "normal," rate of cranial base suture/synchondrosis closure in infancy, the implications of which are unknown.Clinical question/level of evidence: Risk, III.
Craniometric Analysis of Frontal Cranial Morphology Following Posterior Vault Distraction	29521768	Background: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) is believed to improve frontal contour in infants with syndromic craniosynostosis and turribrachycephaly. This study provides an objective craniometric analysis to determine how PVDO affects anterior cranial morphology.Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent PVDO was performed. Inclusion criteria included pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 months before surgery and another 1 to 6 months after device removal. Volumetric and craniometric data were derived using Mimics software and compared using paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Results: About 65 patients underwent PVDO, and 13 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at intervention was 3.4 ¡À 4.2 years. Total cranial volume increased 249 ¡À 159 cm in all patients (P = 0.0001) and 380 ¡À 128 cm in patients younger than 1 year of age (n = 6, P =0 .0008). Supraorbital retrusion decreased from 5.44 ¡À 3.89 to 4.54 ¡À 3.91 mm postoperatively (P = 0.0004), decreasing significantly in patients without previous frontal surgery and not in those with previous frontal surgery (P = 0.2115; comparison P = 0.0047). Basofrontal angle decreased by 2.92 ¡À 2.16 degrees (P = 0.0004) with a greater decrease of 3.33¡À2.68 degrees in those younger than 12 months (P = 0.0289) and 2.58¡À1.74 degrees in those older (P = 0.0079). No change was found in anterior cranial height and anterofrontal angle (P > 0.05).Conclusion: PVDO improves frontal contour by decreasing supraorbital retrusion and reducing frontal bossing in syndromic craniosynostosis patients with turribrachycephaly. When combined with its demonstrated efficacy for cranial expansion, these frontal changes likely reinforce PVDO's ability to influence the timing of, and to a degree, the need for frontal surgery in this group.
Spring-Mediated Cranioplasty in Sagittal Synostosis: Does Age at Placement Affect Expansion?	29381616	Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of timing of surgery and spring characteristics on correction of scaphocephalic deformity in patients undergoing spring-mediated cranioplasty (SMC) for sagittal craniosynostosis.Methods: The authors conducted a review of patients with sagittal craniosynostosis who underwent SMC at a tertiary referral center between July 2011 and March 2017, with a primary outcome measure of head shape, both preoperatively and postoperatively, determined by cephalic index (CI). Patient demographics and operative details including timing of surgery and spring characteristics were collected. Differences in CI preoperation and postoperation were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Ordinary least-squares linear regression was used to assess the impact of timing, number of springs, maximum single spring force, and total spring force on postoperative change in CI.Results: Thirty-six subjects (12 males and 24 females) were included in the study. Mean age at spring placement was 3.9 months (range: 1.9-9.2) with a mean follow-up of 1.4 years (range: 0.3-5.2). The mean number of springs used was 3 (range: 2-4). The mean maximum single spring force was 9.9 Newtons (N) (range: 6.9-13.0) and the mean total spring force was 24.6 N (range: 12.7-37.0). Mean CI increased from 70 ¡À 0.9 preoperatively to 77 ¡À 1.0 postoperatively (P < 0.001). Age at spring placement was significantly associated with change in CI: for every month increase in age, the change in CI decreased by 1.3 (P = 0.03). The number of springs used, greatest single spring force, and total spring force did not correlate with changes in CI (P = 0.85, P = 0.42, and P = 0.84, respectively).Conclusion: In SMC, earlier age at time of surgery appears to correlate with greater improvement in CI, at least in the short-term. While spring characteristics did not appear to affect head shape, it is possible that the authors were underpowered to detect a difference, and spring-related variables likely deserve additional study.
Posterior Vault Distraction Osteogenesis in Nonsyndromic Patients: An Evaluation of Indications and Safety	29381615	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the indications, safety, and short-term outcomes of posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) in patients with no identified acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome (study) and to compare those to a syndromic cohort (controls).Methods: Demographic and perioperative data were recorded and compared across the study and control groups for those who underwent PVDO between January 2009 and December 2016. Univariate analysis was conducted using ¦Ö and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.Results: Sixty-three subjects were included: 19 in the nonsyndromic cohort, 44 in the syndromic cohort. The cohorts had similar proportion of subjects exhibiting pansynostosis (42.1% of nonsyndromic versus 36.4% of syndromic, P = 0.667). The nonsyndromic cohort was significantly older (4.04 ¡À 3.66 years versus 2.55 ¡À 3.34 years, P = 0.046) and had higher rate of signs of raised intracranial pressure (68.4% versus 25.0%, P = 0.001) than the syndromic cohort. There was no significant difference in perioperative variables or rate of complications (P > 0.05). The mean total advancement distance achieved was similar, 27 ¡À 6 mm in the nonsyndromic versus 28 ¡À 8 mm in the syndromic cohort (P = 0.964). All nonsyndromic subjects with signs of raised intracranial pressure demonstrated improvement at an average follow-up of 22 months.Conclusion: As in the syndromic patient, PVDO is a safe and, in the short-term, effective modality for cranial vault expansion in the nonsyndromic patient. The benefits and favorable perioperative profile of PVDO may therefore be extended to patient populations other than those with syndromic craniosynostosis.
Comparative Effectiveness of Retromuscular and Intraperitoneal Repair: What Is the Value of Posterior Sheath Reconstruction?	29697627	Background: The authors hypothesize that posterior sheath reconstruction to achieve retromuscular mesh placement provides outcomes comparable to traditional retromuscular mesh placement and superior to intraperitoneal repair.Methods: Patients were divided into three groups: (1) retromuscular mesh placement with repaired posterior sheath defects, (2) retromuscular repair with an intact posterior sheath, and (3) intraperitoneal repair. Primary outcomes included recurrence, surgical-site occurrences, and cost.Results: Overall, 179 patients were included. Posterior sheath defects were repaired primarily with absorbable suture or biological mesh. Recurrence rates differed significantly between standard retromuscular repair and intraperitoneal repair groups (p < 0.009), trended toward significance between repaired posterior sheath and intraperitoneal repair groups (p < 0.058), and showed no difference between repaired posterior sheath and standard retromuscular repair (p < 0.608). Retromuscular repair was clinically protective and cost-effective.Conclusions: This analysis of posterior sheath reconstruction suggests outcomes comparable to traditional retromuscular repair and a trend toward superiority compared with intraperitoneal repair. Achieving retromuscular closure appears to demonstrate clinical and cost efficacy.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.
Next generation transcriptomics and genomics elucidate biological complexity of microglia in health and disease	26040959	Genome-wide expression profiling technology has resulted in detailed transcriptome data for a wide range of tissues, conditions and diseases. In neuroscience, expression datasets were mostly generated using whole brain tissue samples, resulting in data from a mixture of cell types, including glial cells and neurons. Over the past few years, a rapidly increasing number of expression profiling studies using isolated microglial cell populations have been reported. In these studies, the microglia transcriptome was compared to other cell types, such as other brain cells and peripheral tissue macrophages, and related to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. A commonality found in many of these studies was that microglia possess distinct gene expression signatures. This repertoire of selectively-expressed microglial genes highlight functions beyond immune responses, such as synaptic modulation and neurotrophic support, and open up avenues to explore as-yet-unexpected roles. These data provide improved understanding of disease pathology, and complement not only the aforementioned whole brain tissue transcriptome studies, but also genome- and epigenome-wide association studies. In this review, insights obtained from isolated microglia transcriptome studies are presented, and compared to studies using other genome-wide approaches. The relation of microglia to other tissue macrophages and glial cell populations, as well as the role of microglia in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative conditions, will be discussed. Many more of these types of studies are expected in the near future, hopefully leading to the identification of novel genes and targets for neurodegenerative conditions.Keywords: Alzheimer's disease; aging; amyotrophic lateral sclerosisl epigenetics; gene expression.
5000 Free Flaps and Counting: A 10-Year Review of a Single Academic Institution's Microsurgical Development and Outcomes	29595720	Background: The establishment of an effective clinical and academic culture within an institution is a multifactorial process. This process is cultivated by dynamic elements such as recruitment of an accomplished and diverse faculty, patient geographic outreach, clinical outcomes research, and fundamental support from all levels of an institution. This study reviews the academic evolution of a single academic plastic surgery practice, and summarizes a 10-year experience of microsurgical development, clinical outcomes, and academic productivity.Methods: A 10-year retrospective institutional review was performed from fiscal years 2006 to 2016. Microsurgical flap type and operative volume were measured across all microsurgery faculty and participating hospitals. Microvascular compromise and flap salvage rates were noted for the six highest volume surgeons. Univariate and multivariable predictors of flap salvage were determined.Results: The 5000th flap was performed in December of 2015 within this institutional study period. Looking at the six highest volume surgeons, free flaps were examined for microvascular compromise, with an institutional mean take-back rate of 1.53 percent and flap loss rate of 0.55 percent across all participating hospitals. Overall, 74.4 percent of cases were breast flaps, and the remaining cases were extremity and head and neck flaps.Conclusions: Focused faculty and trainee recruitment has resulted in an academically and clinically productive practice. Collaboration among faculty, staff, and residents contributes to continual learning, innovation, and quality patient care. This established framework, constructed based on experience, offers a workable and reproducible model for other academic plastic surgery institutions.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.
A Sustainable Model for Patient follow-up following an International Cleft Mission: A Proof of Concept	28085514	Purpose: Patient follow-up after cleft missions is imperative if we are to critically assess the quality of care provided in these settings. The adoption of mobile telephones among disadvantaged families abroad may enable such an undertaking in a cost-effective manner. This project aimed to assess the efficacy of cellular phone-based follow-up in a developing country following a cleft mission to Thailand.Methods: Changing Children's Lives Inc. performed a cleft surgical mission to Udon Thani, Thailand, in January 2013. Telephone numbers collected at that time were used to survey the patients or their parents 1.5 years postoperatively.Results: Of the 56 patients who underwent cleft lip and/or palate surgery during the mission, more than 50% ( n = 30, 54%) were reachable by telephone; all chose to participate in the study. The cost for families was U.S. $124.92 (56.15); 26 families (87%) believed their money was well spent. Follow-up care was received by 22 (73%) patients, and all but one family ( n = 29, 97%) felt that their child received all of the medical care and support required. All families ( N = 30) would recommend similar cleft care to a friend. Of the patients younger than 18 years of age ( n = 24, 80%), 20 (80%) families found their child more comfortable interacting with peers, more comfortable interacting with adults, and more confident postoperatively.Conclusion: In one month, a survey response rate of more than 50% was obtained by leveraging the increased adoption of mobile phones in rural settings. Nearly all patients/families treated during the cleft mission were satisfied with the care that they received.Keywords: cleft; cleft lip; cleft palate; medical mission; patient satisfaction; surgical mission.
Evaluation of parental and surgeon stressors and perceptions of distraction osteogenesis in pediatric craniofacial patients: a cross-sectional survey study	29748706	Purpose: There is a paucity of literature on how limitations of distraction osteogenesis (DO) are perceived by physicians and parents of pediatric patients. Specifically understanding which features of DO are most concerning to these two groups may better inform parent education, as well as direct improvements in distraction protocols and devices.Method: Parents/guardians of patients (between January 2016 and October 2017) being treated with craniofacial distraction were recruited to complete a survey regarding level of stress (1 = not stressful, 9 = maximally stressful) associated with eight features of DO. Craniofacial surgeons completed a survey asking them to report (1) their personal level of stress and (2) their perceptions of parental stress regarding these same eight features of DO.Results: Thirty-five parents and 15 craniofacial surgeons completed the survey. The risk of the device getting infected was perceived as most stressful by parents (5.5 ¡À 2.3) followed by the device sticking through the skin (4.9 ¡À 2.6) and the second operation for removal (4.7 ¡À 2.3). These same three features also elicited the highest level of stress among surgeons. Surgeon-perceived parental stress regarding turning of the distractor (5.8 ¡À 1.5) was significantly higher than parent self-reported stress (4.2 ¡À 2.8, p = 0.042).Conclusions: Both parents and surgeons perceive risk of device-associated infection, the protrusion of the device through the skin, and the requirement of a second operation for removal as the most stressful drawbacks of distraction. Infection reduction protocols, less obtrusive devices, and devices that do not require removal are potential targets for stress reduction.Keywords: Craniosynostosis; Device; Infection; Surgery.
A Craniometric Analysis of the Posterior Cranial Base After Posterior Vault Distraction	31033762	Background: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) has been demonstrated to effectively increase intracranial volume, treat increased intracranial pressure, and improve head shape in syndromic patients. The purpose of this study is to compare changes along the posterior cranial base before and after distraction.Methods: A retrospective review was completed of subjects who underwent PVDO with computed tomography scans at 2 time-points: within 3 months preoperatively and 1 to 6 months postoperatively. Using Mimics software, craniometric landmarks were identified and surface area of the foramen magnum was calculated. A comparison of pre- to postoperative measurements was completed using Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank tests and linear regression.Results: A total of 65 PVDO subjects were identified, 12 subjects met inclusion criteria. Mean operative age was 3.0 ¡À 4.0 years. The cranial vault was distracted on average 25.0 ¡À 6.0 mm, with those < 12 months of age distracted 29.5 ¡À 4.9 mm and >12 months of age distracted 22.0 ¡À 4.9 mm (P = 0.0543). There was a significant increase in pre- to postoperative foramen magnum surface area (52.1 ¡À 63.2 mm, P = 0.002), length (0.9 ¡À 1.4 mm, P = 0.050), and width (0.6 ¡À 1.0 mm, P = 0.050). Similarly, linear distances between nasion and posterior cranial base landmarks such as foramen magnum (3.4 ¡À 4.2 mm, P = 0.010), and occipital protuberance (9.1 ¡À 9.6 mm, P = 0.003) were increased. Subjects under 12 months had a greater percentage increases in posterior vault length than those over 12 months.Conclusion: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis is associated with an increase in size of the foramen magnum, and lengthening of the posterior cranial base, both of which may be beneficial in patients with turribrachycephaly.
The Effects of Multi-Day vs. Single Pre-exercise Nitrate Supplement Dosing on Simulated Cycling Time Trial Performance and Skeletal Muscle Oxygenation	28445231	Jo, E, Fischer, M, Auslander, AT, Beigarten, A, Daggy, B, Hansen, K, Kessler, L, Osmond, A, Wang, H, and Wes, R. The effects of multiday vs. single pre-exercise nitrate supplement dosing on simulated cycling time trial performance and skeletal muscle oxygenation. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 217-224, 2019-A transient augmentation in the metabolic efficiency of skeletal muscle is the purported basis for dietary nitrate supplementation amongst competitive and recreational athletes alike. Previous studies support the ergogenic effects of nitrate supplementation, as findings indicated improved microvascular blood flow, exercise economy, and performance with relatively short-term supplementation. As with most ergogenic aids, the optimum duration of supplementation before performance or competition, i.e., loading phase, is a critical determinant for efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term vs. single dosing nitrate supplementation on skeletal muscle oxygenation and cycling performance. In a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, parallel design study, healthy, recreationally active men (n = 15) and women (n = 14) subjects (age = 18-29 years) completed an 8 km (5 mi) simulated cycling time trial before and after a 14-day supplementation period with either a nitrate supplement (Multi-Day Dosing Group) (n = 14) or placebo (Single Pre-Exercise Dosing Group; SD) (n = 15). Both groups consumed a single dose of the nitrate supplement 2 hours before the post-treatment time trial. In addition, skeletal muscle oxygenation was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy during each time trial. Multiday nitrate supplementation significantly decreased time to completion (p = 0.01) and increased average power (p = 0.04) and speed (p = 0.02) from pre-to post-treatment, while a single dosing produced no significant changes to these measures. There were no significant differences over time and across treatments for any other measures including muscle oxygenation variables. Overall, long-term nitrate supplementation appears to have an advantage over a single pre-exercise dosing on cycling performance and metabolic efficiency as indicated by an increase in power output with no change in oxygenation.
