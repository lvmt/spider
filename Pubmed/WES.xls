27355281	Swimmer's Shoulder: Painful Shoulder in the Competitive Swimmer	Swimmer's shoulder is a broad term often used to diagnose shoulder injury in swimmers. However, research has elucidated several specific shoulder injuries that often are incurred by the competitive swimmer. Hyperlaxity, scapular dyskinesis, subacromial impingement, labral damage, os acromiale, suprascapular nerve entrapment, and glenohumeral rotational imbalances all may be included within a differential diagnosis for shoulder pain in the competitive swimmer. An understanding of the mechanics of the swim stroke, in combination with the complex static and dynamic properties of the shoulder, is essential to the comprehension and identification of the painful swimmer's shoulder. It is important for the athlete, coach, and clinician to be aware of the discerning characteristics among these different injuries to ensure a proper diagnosis and treatment plan to aid the swimmer in his or her return to competition.	游泳者的肩膀是一个广泛的术语，通常用于诊断游泳者的肩部受伤。然而，研究已经阐明了竞技游泳者经常造成的几种特定的肩部受伤。松弛性，肩cap运动障碍，肩峰下撞击，阴唇损伤，肩峰，肩cap上神经压迫和肩肱旋转不平衡均包括在该竞争性游泳者肩痛的鉴别诊断中。对游泳姿势的理解以及肩膀复杂的静态和动态特性的理解，对于理解和识别痛苦的游泳者肩膀至关重要。对于运动员，教练和临床医生而言，重要的是要意识到这些不同伤害之间的区别特征，以确保制定适当的诊断和治疗计划，以帮助游泳者恢复比赛。
28671693	Transcriptomic analysis of purified human cortical microglia reveals age-associated changes	Microglia are essential for CNS homeostasis and innate neuroimmune function, and play important roles in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Here we present gene expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. Overall, genes expressed by human microglia were similar to those in mouse, including established microglial genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and ITGAM (CD11B). However, a number of immune genes, not identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed in human microglia, including TLR, Fcγ and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression and actin (dis)assembly. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently.	小胶质细胞对于中枢神经系统的稳态和先天神经免疫功能至关重要，并且在神经变性和脑衰老中起重要作用。在这里，我们介绍了从完整解剖的39名人类受试者的顶叶皮层解剖时分离出的纯化小胶质细胞的基因表达谱。总体而言，人类小胶质细胞表达的基因与小鼠相似，包括已建立的小胶质细胞基因CX3CR1，P2RY12和ITGAM（CD11B）。但是，许多免疫基因（未鉴定为小鼠小神经胶质标记的一部分）在人小胶质细胞中大量表达，包括TLR，Fcγ和SIGLEC受体以及TAL1和IFI16，它们是增殖和细胞周期的调节剂。人类小胶质细胞中与年龄相关的变化丰富了与细胞粘附，轴突导向，细胞表面受体表达和肌动蛋白（解）装配有关的基因。在小鼠和人类之间的衰老过程中调节的小神经胶质基因中观察到有限的重叠，这表明人类和小鼠的小胶质细胞的年龄不同。
27100611	Targeting microglia for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease	While histological changes in microglia have long been recognized as a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent genetic association studies have also strongly implicated microglia in the etiology of the disease. Coding and noncoding polymorphisms in several genes expressed in microglia-including APOE, TREM2, CD33, GRN, and IL1RAP-alter AD risk, and therefore could be considered as entry points for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, microglia may have a substantial effect on current amyloid β (Aβ) and tau immunotherapy approaches, since they are the primary cell type in the brain to mediate Fc receptor-facilitated antibody effector function. In this review, we discuss the considerations in selecting microglial therapeutic targets from the perspective of drug discovery feasibility, and consider the role of microglia in ongoing immunotherapy clinical strategies.

26001565	Induction of a common microglia gene expression signature by aging and neurodegenerative conditions: a co-expression meta-analysis	Introduction: Microglia are tissue macrophages of the central nervous system that monitor brain homeostasis and react upon neuronal damage and stress. Aging and neurodegeneration induce a hypersensitive, pro-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as primed microglia. To determine the gene expression signature of priming, the transcriptomes of microglia in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models were compared using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA).Results: A highly consistent consensus transcriptional profile of up-regulated genes was identified, which prominently differed from the acute inflammatory gene network induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Where the acute inflammatory network was significantly enriched for NF-κB signaling, the primed microglia profile contained key features related to phagosome, lysosome, antigen presentation, and AD signaling. In addition, specific signatures for aging, AD, and ALS were identified.Conclusion: Microglia priming induces a highly conserved transcriptional signature with aging- and disease-specific aspects.	简介：小胶质细胞是中枢神经系统的组织巨噬细胞，可监测脑稳态并对神经元损伤和压力做出反应。衰老和神经退行性变会诱发过敏性，促炎性表型，称为引发小胶质细胞。为了确定引发的基因表达特征，使用加权基因共表达网络分析（WGCNA）对衰老，阿尔茨海默氏病（AD）和肌萎缩性侧索硬化（ALS）小鼠模型中的小胶质细胞的转录组进行了比较。结果：高度一致鉴定出上调基因的共有转录谱，其与脂多糖（LPS）诱导的急性炎症基因网络有显着差异。在急性炎症网络中NF-κB信号显着丰富的地方，引发的小胶质细胞特征包含与吞噬体，溶酶体，抗原呈递和AD信号有关的关键特征。此外，还鉴定出了衰老，AD和ALS的特异性特征。结论：小胶质细胞引发可诱导具有高度衰老和疾病特异性的高度保守的转录特征。
27246804	Critical data-based re-evaluation of minocycline as a putative specific microglia inhibitor	Minocycline, a second generation broad-spectrum antibiotic, has been frequently postulated to be a "microglia inhibitor." A considerable number of publications have used minocycline as a tool and concluded, after achieving a pharmacological effect, that the effect must be due to "inhibition" of microglia. It is, however, unclear how this "inhibition" is achieved at the molecular and cellular levels. Here, we weigh the evidence whether minocycline is indeed a bona fide microglia inhibitor and discuss how data generated with minocycline should be interpreted. GLIA 2016;64:1788-1794.Keywords: inhibitor; lack of specificity; microglia; minocycline.	米诺环素是第二代广谱抗生素，经常被假定为“小胶质细胞抑制剂”。大量出版物已使用美满霉素作为工具，并在达到药理作用后得出结论，认为该作用必须归因于小胶质细胞的“抑制”。但是，尚不清楚如何在分子和细胞水平上实现这种“抑制”。在这里，我们权衡了米诺环素是否确实是真正的小胶质细胞抑制剂的证据，并讨论了如何解释米诺环素产生的数据。 GLIA 2016; 64：1788-1794。关键词：抑制剂;缺乏特异性；小胶质细胞米诺环素。
25933020	Passive immunization with phospho-tau antibodies reduces tau pathology and functional deficits in two distinct mouse tauopathy models	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), an extensive accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau tangles, along with neuronal loss, is evident in distinct brain regions. Staging of tau pathology by postmortem analysis of AD subjects suggests a sequence of initiation and subsequent spread of neurofibrillary tau tangles along defined brain anatomical pathways. Further, the severity of cognitive deficits correlates with the degree and extent of tau pathology. In this study, we demonstrate that phospho-tau (p-tau) antibodies, PHF6 and PHF13, can prevent the induction of tau pathology in primary neuron cultures. The impact of passive immunotherapy on the formation and spread of tau pathology, as well as functional deficits, was subsequently evaluated with these antibodies in two distinct transgenic mouse tauopathy models. The rTg4510 transgenic mouse is characterized by inducible over-expression of P301L mutant tau, and exhibits robust age-dependent brain tau pathology. Systemic treatment with PHF6 and PHF13 from 3 to 6 months of age led to a significant decline in brain and CSF p-tau levels. In a second model, injection of preformed tau fibrils (PFFs) comprised of recombinant tau protein encompassing the microtubule-repeat domains into the cortex and hippocampus of young P301S mutant tau over-expressing mice (PS19) led to robust tau pathology on the ipsilateral side with evidence of spread to distant sites, including the contralateral hippocampus and bilateral entorhinal cortex 4 weeks post-injection. Systemic treatment with PHF13 led to a significant decline in the spread of tau pathology in this model. The reduction in tau species after p-tau antibody treatment was associated with an improvement in novel-object recognition memory test in both models. These studies provide evidence supporting the use of tau immunotherapy as a potential treatment option for AD and other tauopathies.	在阿尔茨海默氏病（AD）中，在不同的大脑区域明显可见大量的细胞外淀粉样斑块和神经元内tau缠结以及神经元丢失。通过对AD受试者进行死后分析对tau病理进行分期，表明神经原纤维tau缠结沿着定义的大脑解剖路径的一系列起始和随后扩散。此外，认知缺陷的严重程度与tau病理学的程度和程度有关。在这项研究中，我们证明磷酸化tau（p-tau）抗体PHF6和PHF13可以防止在主要神经元培养物中诱导tau病理。随后在两个不同的转基因小鼠tauopathy模型中使用这些抗体评估了被动免疫疗法对tau病理的形成和扩散以及功能缺陷的影响。 rTg4510转基因小鼠的特征在于可诱导的P301L突变tau的过表达，并表现出强大的年龄依赖性脑tau病理。在3到6个月大时使用PHF6和PHF13进行全身治疗导致大脑和CSF p-tau水平显着下降。在第二种模型中，将包含重组tau蛋白的预制tau原纤维（PFF）包含微管重复域，注入年轻的P301S突变tau过表达小鼠（PS19）的皮层和海马中，导致同侧的tau病理牢固注射后4周，有证据显示扩散到远处，包括对侧海马和双侧内嗅皮层。在该模型中，用PHF13进行全身治疗导致tau病理学扩散显着下降。 p-tau抗体处理后tau物种的减少与两个模型中新对象识别记忆测试的改善有关。这些研究提供了支持使用tau免疫疗法作为AD和其他Tauopathies的潜在治疗选择的证据。
29068970	More Than Meets the Eye: The Effect of Intercanthal Distance on Perception of Beauty and Personality	In judging normalcy, surgeons rely on established facial anthropometric measures and proportions. However, there exists a range of "normal," and a degree of disproportion may be considered more attractive. The authors set out to determine how changes in only intercanthal distance affect the layperson's perception of beauty and personality traits of a face. The authors used Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing tool, to determine how changes in intercanthal distance affect overall perception of beauty and personality. MTurk respondents provided demographic information and were asked to survey 16 female subjects, each digitally edited to be hypoteloric or hyperteloric. Data were collected from 490 MTurk crowd raters. Paired t test analysis found that respondents perceived subjects to be more submissive, friendly, and attractive with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). Women respondents were less likely to perceive change in regards to how unthreatening and how intelligent the subject appeared upon intercanthal widening (P < 0.05). Compared with Caucasian respondents, minorities (Asian- and African-American) were more likely to perceive difference in submissiveness, threat, intelligence, and attractiveness with increased intercanthal distance (P < 0.05). All respondents >46 years of age were less likely to perceive a change in any of the 7 traits upon intercanthal widening, compared with respondents between 18 and 25 years of age (P < 0.05). The layperson perceives significant increases in a female subject's submissivness, friendliness, and attractiveness with an intercanthal distance increase of 10% from normal. Surgeons should be aware of this when correcting hypertelorism, given the potential positive impact of a slightly increased intercanthal distance on perceived beauty and personality.	在判断正常性时，外科医生要依靠既定的面部人体测量方法和比例。但是，存在“正常”范围，并且不均衡的程度可能被认为更具吸引力。作者着手确定仅眼间距离的变化如何影响外行人对美感和面部个性特征的感知。作者使用Amazon.com的Mechanical Turk（MTurk）（一种众包工具）来确定眼间距离的变化如何影响整体对美感和个性的感知。 MTurk的受访者提供了人口统计信息，并被要求调查16位女性受试者，每位受试者均经过数字编辑以评估其是否为玻璃纤维变性或纤维变性。数据是从490位MTurk人群评估者那里收集的。配对t检验分析发现，被调查者认为受试者随着can间距离的增加而更加顺从，友善和有吸引力（P <0.05）。女性受访者不太可能觉察到在进行眼间扩大时受试者的威胁性和机敏性如何变化（P <0.05）。与高加索受访者相比，少数族裔（亚裔和非裔美国人）更容易感觉到随距离增大的顺从性，威胁性，智力和吸引力（P <0.05）。与年龄在18至25岁之间的受访者相比，所有年龄在46岁以上的受访者在进行眼间扩大后都不太可能感知到7个特征中的任何一个改变（P <0.05）。外行人感觉女性对象的顺从性，友善性和吸引力大大增加，与正常人之间的距离增加了10％。考虑到眼间距离略微增加可能对感知的美感和性格产生潜在的积极影响，外科医生在矫正超视力时应意识到这一点。
29579020	Quality of Life in Adults with Nonsyndromic Craniosynostosis	Background: Although studies have analyzed quality of life in children with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, to date nobody has investigated long-term quality of life in adults with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis. The purpose of this study was to compare quality of life in adult nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients with a cohort of unaffected controls.Methods: The authors queried their institution's prospectively maintained craniofacial registry for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients aged 18 years and older, and administered the validated World Health Organization Quality of Life Biomedical Research and Education Foundation questionnaire. Responses were compared, using a two-sample t test, to an age-matched U.S. normative database provided by the World Health Organization.Results: One hundred fifty-one adults met inclusion criteria: 52 were successfully contacted and 32 completed the questionnaire. Average age of respondents was 23.0 ± 6.1 years (range, 18.1 to 42.1 years). Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients had a superior quality of life compared with comparative norms in all domains: physical health (17.8 ± 2.7 versus 15.5 ± 3.2; p < 0.001), psychological (16.3 ± 2.9 versus 13.8 ± 3.2; p < 0.001), social (16.9 ± 2.6 versus 13.2 ± 3.6; p < 0.001), and environmental (17.2 ± 2.5 versus 11.7 ± 2.7; p < 0.001). Comparison between single-suture subtypes revealed no difference in any quality-of-life domain (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Adult patients previously treated for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis perceive their quality of life to be high, superior to that of a normative U.S.Sample: Future work will seek to analyze additional patients and better understand the reasons behind these findings.	背景：尽管研究已经分析了非综合征性颅前鼻窦炎儿童的生活质量，但迄今为止，还没有人研究非综合征性颅前鼻窦炎成年人的长期生活质量。这项研究的目的是比较未患病的成年非综合征性颅骨融合症患者的生活质量。组织生命质量生物医学研究和教育基金会调查表。使用两样本t检验，将回答与世界卫生组织提供的年龄匹配的美国规范数据库进行比较。结果：151名符合入选标准的成年人：成功联系了52名成年人，完成了问卷调查的32名。受访者的平均年龄为23.0±6.1岁（范围为18.1至42.1岁）。与所有领域的比较规范相比，非综合症的颅骨前突合并症患者的生活质量更高：身体健康（17.8±2.7对15.5±3.2； p <0.001），心理（16.3±2.9对13.8±3.2； p <0.001），社交（ 16.9±2.6对13.2±3.6; p <0.001）和环境（17.2±2.5对11.7±2.7; p <0.001）。单线缝合亚型之间的比较显示，在任何生活质量域中均无差异（p> 0.05）。结论：以前接受过非综合征性颅脑前突治疗的成年患者认为他们的生活质量很高，优于标准的USSample：未来的工作将寻求分析更多的患者，并更好地理解这些发现背后的原因。
29351184	Cleft-Palate Repair: Does Hospital Case-Volume Impact Outcomes or Cost?	Background: How hospital case-volume affects operative outcomes and cost continues to grow in importance. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of case volume with operative outcomes and cost in cleft palate repair.Methods: Subjects undergoing cleft palate repair between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the Pediatric Health Information System. Outcomes were compared between two groups: those undergoing treatment at a high-volume institution, and those undergoing treatment at a low-volume institution. Primary outcomes were as follows: any complication, prolonged length of stay, and increased total cost.Results: Over 20,000 patients (n = 20,320) from 49 institutions met inclusion criteria. On univariate analysis, those subjects who underwent treatment at a high-volume institution had a lower rate of overall complications (3.4 percent versus 5.1 percent; p < 0.001), and lower rates of prolonged length of stay (4.5 percent versus 5.8 percent; p < 0.001) and increased total cost (48.6 percent versus 50.9 percent; p = 0.002). In multivariate regression analyses, subjects treated in high-volume centers were less likely to experience any complication (OR, 0.678; p < 0.001) and were less likely to have an extended length of stay (OR, 0.82; p = 0.005). Subjects undergoing palate repair at a high-volume institution were no less likely to incur increased total cost (OR, 1.01; p = 0.805).Conclusion: In institutions performing a high volume of cleft palate repairs, subjects had significantly decreased odds of experiencing a complication or prolonged length of stay.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.	背景：医院病例数如何影响手术结局和费用继续变得越来越重要。这项研究的目的是检查pa裂修复病例数与手术结果和费用之间的关系。方法：在儿科健康信息系统中识别出2004年至2015年间进行left裂修复的受试者。在两组中比较了结果：在高容量机构中接受治疗的人和在低容量机构中接受治疗的人。主要结果如下：任何并发症，延长的住院时间和增加的总费用。结果：来自49个机构的20,000多名患者（n = 20,320）符合纳入标准。在单因素分析中，那些在高容量机构接受治疗的受试者的总体并发症发生率较低（3.4％比5.1％； p <0.001），长期住院率较低（4.5％比5.8％； p <0.001）并增加了总成本（48.6％对50.9％； p = 0.002）。在多变量回归分析中，在高容量中心接受治疗的受试者发生任何并发症的可能性较小（OR，0.678； p <0.001），住院时间延长的可能性较小（OR，0.82； p = 0.005）。在高容量的机构中进行repair裂修复的受试者总费用增加的可能性也不低（OR，1.01； p = 0.805）。结论：在进行left裂修复的机构中，受试者发生of裂的几率显着降低并发症或长期住院。临床问题/证据水平：治疗III。
29595734	Incidence of Cranial Base Suture Fusion in Infants with Craniosynostosis	Background: Cranial base sutures are important drivers of both facial and cranial growth. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence and location of cranial base suture fusion among three groups: nonaffected controls, patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.Methods: Patients and computed tomographic scans were accrued from the authors' prospective craniofacial database. Computed tomographic scans were graded on the frequency of cranial vault and cranial base suture/synchondrosis fusion (0, open; 1, partially/completely fused) by an attending craniofacial surgeon and neuroradiologist. Statistical comparisons were conducted on location and rates of fusion, age, and diagnosis.Results: One hundred forty patients met inclusion criteria: 55 syndromic, 64 nonsyndromic, and 21 controls. Average age at computed tomography of syndromic patients (3.6 ± 3.1 months) was younger than that of nonsyndromic patients (5.4 ± 3.1 months; p = 0.001) and control subjects (5.1 ± 3.2 months; p = 0.058). Syndromic craniosynostotic patients had over three times as many cranial base minor sutures fused (2.2 ± 2.5) as nonsyndromic craniosynostosis patients (0.7 ± 1.2; p < 0.001) and controls (0.4 ± 0.8; p = 0.002), whose rates of fusion were statistically equivalent (p = 0.342). Syndromic craniosynostosis patients had a greater frequency of cranial base suture fusion in the coronal branches, squamosal arch, and posterior intraoccipital synchondrosis (p < 0.05).Conclusions: Patients with syndromic craniosynostosis have higher rates of cranial base suture fusion in infancy, especially in the coronal arches, and this may have significant implications for both cranial and facial growth. In contrast, patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis have similar rates and sites of cranial base suture fusion as controls. Interestingly, there is a low, "normal," rate of cranial base suture/synchondrosis closure in infancy, the implications of which are unknown.Clinical question/level of evidence: Risk, III.	背景：颅底缝合线是面部和颅骨生长的重要驱动力。这项研究的目的是比较三组患者的颅底缝合线融合的发生率和位置：未受影响的对照组，非综合征性颅骨融合症患者和综合征性颅骨融合症患者。方法：患者和计算机断层扫描来自作者的前瞻性颅面数据库。主动脉颅外科医生和神经放射科医生根据颅穹ault和颅底缝线/软骨融合（0，开放； 1，部分/完全融合）的频率对计算机断层扫描进行分级。结果：一百四十名患者符合纳入标准：55例，64例和21例对照。有症状的患者（3.6±3.1个月）的计算机体层摄影术的平均年龄比非有症状的患者（5.4±3.1个月； p = 0.001）和对照组（5.1±3.2个月； p = 0.058）年轻。有症状的颅骨纵缝融合患者（2.2±2.5）的颅底小缝线融合率（0.7±1.2; p <0.001）和对照组（0.4±0.8; p = 0.002）是无症状的颅骨轻度缝合的三倍以上。等效（p = 0.342）。颅骨综合征患者在冠状分支，鳞状弓和后枕骨内软骨融合症中的颅底缝线融合频率更高（p <0.05）。冠状弓，这可能对颅骨和面部生长都有重要影响。相比之下，患有非综合征性颅骨融合症的患者颅底缝线融合的发生率和部位与对照组相似。有趣的是，婴儿期颅底缝合线/软骨间闭症的发生率较低，“正常”，其影响尚不清楚。临床问题/证据水平：风险，III。
29521768	Craniometric Analysis of Frontal Cranial Morphology Following Posterior Vault Distraction	Background: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) is believed to improve frontal contour in infants with syndromic craniosynostosis and turribrachycephaly. This study provides an objective craniometric analysis to determine how PVDO affects anterior cranial morphology.Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent PVDO was performed. Inclusion criteria included pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 months before surgery and another 1 to 6 months after device removal. Volumetric and craniometric data were derived using Mimics software and compared using paired t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Results: About 65 patients underwent PVDO, and 13 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age at intervention was 3.4 ± 4.2 years. Total cranial volume increased 249 ± 159 cm in all patients (P = 0.0001) and 380 ± 128 cm in patients younger than 1 year of age (n = 6, P =0 .0008). Supraorbital retrusion decreased from 5.44 ± 3.89 to 4.54 ± 3.91 mm postoperatively (P = 0.0004), decreasing significantly in patients without previous frontal surgery and not in those with previous frontal surgery (P = 0.2115; comparison P = 0.0047). Basofrontal angle decreased by 2.92 ± 2.16 degrees (P = 0.0004) with a greater decrease of 3.33±2.68 degrees in those younger than 12 months (P = 0.0289) and 2.58±1.74 degrees in those older (P = 0.0079). No change was found in anterior cranial height and anterofrontal angle (P > 0.05).Conclusion: PVDO improves frontal contour by decreasing supraorbital retrusion and reducing frontal bossing in syndromic craniosynostosis patients with turribrachycephaly. When combined with its demonstrated efficacy for cranial expansion, these frontal changes likely reinforce PVDO's ability to influence the timing of, and to a degree, the need for frontal surgery in this group.	背景：后穹dis牵张成骨（PVDO）被认为可改善患有综合征性颅脑前突和头颅短头畸形的婴儿的额叶轮廓。这项研究提供了客观的颅骨分析，以确定PVDO如何影响前颅的形态。方法：对接受PVDO的患者进行回顾性图表审查。纳入标准包括术前和术后3个月内以及设备移除后1到6个月内的计算机断层扫描（CT）扫描。使用Mimics软件导出体积和颅骨数据，并使用配对t检验和Wilcoxon秩和检验进行比较。结果：约65例患者接受了PVDO，其中13例符合纳入标准。干预时的平均年龄为3.4±4.2岁。所有患者的总颅体积增加249±159 cm（P = 0.0001），小于1岁的患者的总颅体积增加380±128 cm（n = 6，P = 0.0008）。眶上回缩术后从5.44±3.89毫米降低到4.54±3.91毫米（P = 0.0004），在没有进行过前额叶手术的患者和没有进行过前额叶手术的患者中显着降低（P = 0.2115；比较P = 0.0047）。基底额角下降了2.92±2.16度（P = 0.0004），而年龄小于12个月的患者（P = 0.0289）下降了3.33±2.68度，而年龄较大的患者（P = 0.0079）下降了2.58±1.74度。结论：PVDO通过减少眶上回缩和减少颅突突性合并颅脑前突患者的前额凸出而改善了额叶轮廓，前颅高和前额角均无变化（P> 0.05）。结合其已证实的颅骨扩张功效，这些额叶改变可能会增强PVDO影响该组额叶手术时机的能力，并在一定程度上影响额叶手术的需求。
29381616	Spring-Mediated Cranioplasty in Sagittal Synostosis: Does Age at Placement Affect Expansion?	Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of timing of surgery and spring characteristics on correction of scaphocephalic deformity in patients undergoing spring-mediated cranioplasty (SMC) for sagittal craniosynostosis.Methods: The authors conducted a review of patients with sagittal craniosynostosis who underwent SMC at a tertiary referral center between July 2011 and March 2017, with a primary outcome measure of head shape, both preoperatively and postoperatively, determined by cephalic index (CI). Patient demographics and operative details including timing of surgery and spring characteristics were collected. Differences in CI preoperation and postoperation were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Ordinary least-squares linear regression was used to assess the impact of timing, number of springs, maximum single spring force, and total spring force on postoperative change in CI.Results: Thirty-six subjects (12 males and 24 females) were included in the study. Mean age at spring placement was 3.9 months (range: 1.9-9.2) with a mean follow-up of 1.4 years (range: 0.3-5.2). The mean number of springs used was 3 (range: 2-4). The mean maximum single spring force was 9.9 Newtons (N) (range: 6.9-13.0) and the mean total spring force was 24.6 N (range: 12.7-37.0). Mean CI increased from 70 ± 0.9 preoperatively to 77 ± 1.0 postoperatively (P < 0.001). Age at spring placement was significantly associated with change in CI: for every month increase in age, the change in CI decreased by 1.3 (P = 0.03). The number of springs used, greatest single spring force, and total spring force did not correlate with changes in CI (P = 0.85, P = 0.42, and P = 0.84, respectively).Conclusion: In SMC, earlier age at time of surgery appears to correlate with greater improvement in CI, at least in the short-term. While spring characteristics did not appear to affect head shape, it is possible that the authors were underpowered to detect a difference, and spring-related variables likely deserve additional study.	目的：本研究的目的是评估手术时机和弹簧特性对接受弹簧介导的颅骨成形术（SMC）进行矢状颅突狭窄的患者的头颅畸形矫正的效果。他们在2011年7月至2017年3月期间在三级转诊中心接受了SMC手术，其术前和术后的头形主要结果指标由头指数（CI）决定。收集患者的人口统计资料和手术细节，包括手术时间和弹簧特性。使用Wilcoxon秩和检验比较CI术前和术后的差异。普通最小二乘线性回归用于评估时机，弹簧数量，最大单弹簧力和总弹簧力对CI术后变化的影响。结果：纳入了36名受试者（男性12例，女性24例）。研究。春季安置的平均年龄为3.9个月（范围：1.9-9.2），平均随访时间为1.4年（范围：0.3-5.2）。使用的平均弹簧数为3（范围：2-4）。平均最大单弹簧力为9.9牛顿（N）（范围：6.9-13.0），平均总弹簧力为24.6 N（范围：12.7-37.0）。平均CI从术前的70±0.9增加到术后的77±1.0（P <0.001）。春季安置的年龄与CI的变化显着相关：随着年龄的增加，CI的变化每减少1.3（P = 0.03）。使用的弹簧数量，最大单弹簧力和总弹簧力与CI的变化无关（分别为P = 0.85，P = 0.42和P = 0.84）。结论：在SMC中，手术时年龄较早至少在短期内似乎与CI的更大改善相关。尽管弹簧特性似乎并未影响头部形状，但作者可能没有足够的能力来检测差异，并且与弹簧相关的变量可能值得进一步研究。
29381615	Posterior Vault Distraction Osteogenesis in Nonsyndromic Patients: An Evaluation of Indications and Safety	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the indications, safety, and short-term outcomes of posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) in patients with no identified acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome (study) and to compare those to a syndromic cohort (controls).Methods: Demographic and perioperative data were recorded and compared across the study and control groups for those who underwent PVDO between January 2009 and December 2016. Univariate analysis was conducted using χ and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.Results: Sixty-three subjects were included: 19 in the nonsyndromic cohort, 44 in the syndromic cohort. The cohorts had similar proportion of subjects exhibiting pansynostosis (42.1% of nonsyndromic versus 36.4% of syndromic, P = 0.667). The nonsyndromic cohort was significantly older (4.04 ± 3.66 years versus 2.55 ± 3.34 years, P = 0.046) and had higher rate of signs of raised intracranial pressure (68.4% versus 25.0%, P = 0.001) than the syndromic cohort. There was no significant difference in perioperative variables or rate of complications (P > 0.05). The mean total advancement distance achieved was similar, 27 ± 6 mm in the nonsyndromic versus 28 ± 8 mm in the syndromic cohort (P = 0.964). All nonsyndromic subjects with signs of raised intracranial pressure demonstrated improvement at an average follow-up of 22 months.Conclusion: As in the syndromic patient, PVDO is a safe and, in the short-term, effective modality for cranial vault expansion in the nonsyndromic patient. The benefits and favorable perioperative profile of PVDO may therefore be extended to patient populations other than those with syndromic craniosynostosis.	目的：本研究的目的是评估未确诊为肩突综合征的患者的后穹dis牵张成骨（PVDO）的适应症，安全性和近期结局（研究），并将其与综合症患者进行比较（对照）。方法：记录和比较2009年1月至2016年12月接受PVDO治疗的研究者和对照组的人口统计学和围手术期数据。使用χ和Fisher精确检验对分类变量进行单变量分析，对连续变量进行Mann-Whitney U检验结果：共纳入了63名受试者：非综合症队列19名，综合症队列44名。队列中有显示全鼻窦增生的受试者比例相似（非综合征患者的42.1％与综合征患者的36.4％，P = 0.667）。非综合症状队列的年龄明显高于综合症状队列（4.04±3.66岁对2.55±3.34岁，P = 0.046），颅内压升高的征象发生率更高（68.4％对25.0％，P = 0.001）。围手术期变量或并发症发生率无显着差异（P> 0.05）。达到的平均总前进距离相似，非综合症患者为27±6 mm，而综合症患者队列为28±8 mm（P = 0.964）。所有具有颅内压升高迹象的非综合症患者平均随访22个月均表现出改善。结论：与综合症患者一样，PVDO是短期内非综合症中颅穹ault扩张的安全且有效的方式患者。因此，PVDO的益处和良好的围手术期特征可以扩展到除具有综合征性颅脑前突的患者人群以外的人群。
29697627	Comparative Effectiveness of Retromuscular and Intraperitoneal Repair: What Is the Value of Posterior Sheath Reconstruction?	Background: The authors hypothesize that posterior sheath reconstruction to achieve retromuscular mesh placement provides outcomes comparable to traditional retromuscular mesh placement and superior to intraperitoneal repair.Methods: Patients were divided into three groups: (1) retromuscular mesh placement with repaired posterior sheath defects, (2) retromuscular repair with an intact posterior sheath, and (3) intraperitoneal repair. Primary outcomes included recurrence, surgical-site occurrences, and cost.Results: Overall, 179 patients were included. Posterior sheath defects were repaired primarily with absorbable suture or biological mesh. Recurrence rates differed significantly between standard retromuscular repair and intraperitoneal repair groups (p < 0.009), trended toward significance between repaired posterior sheath and intraperitoneal repair groups (p < 0.058), and showed no difference between repaired posterior sheath and standard retromuscular repair (p < 0.608). Retromuscular repair was clinically protective and cost-effective.Conclusions: This analysis of posterior sheath reconstruction suggests outcomes comparable to traditional retromuscular repair and a trend toward superiority compared with intraperitoneal repair. Achieving retromuscular closure appears to demonstrate clinical and cost efficacy.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, III.	背景：作者假设后鞘重建可实现后肌网放置，其结果可与传统后肌网放置相媲美，且优于腹膜内修复。方法：患者分为三组：（1）后肌缺损修复后肌网放置（（ 2）后壁完整的后肌修复，以及（3）腹膜内修复。主要结局包括复发，手术部位的发生和费用。结果：总共纳入179例患者。后鞘缺损主要用可吸收的缝合线或生物网修复。标准后肌修复和腹膜内修复组之间的复发率有显着差异（p <0.009），后鞘和腹膜内修复组之间的复发趋势显着（p <0.058），并且后鞘和标准后肌修复之间无差异（p <0.008）。 0.608）。后肌修复在临床上具有保护作用且具有成本效益。结论：对后鞘重建的分析表明，其结果可与传统的后肌修复相媲美，并且与腹膜内修复相比具有优越的趋势。实现后肌封闭似乎证明了其临床和成本效益。临床问题/证据水平：Therapeutic，III。
26040959	Next generation transcriptomics and genomics elucidate biological complexity of microglia in health and disease	Genome-wide expression profiling technology has resulted in detailed transcriptome data for a wide range of tissues, conditions and diseases. In neuroscience, expression datasets were mostly generated using whole brain tissue samples, resulting in data from a mixture of cell types, including glial cells and neurons. Over the past few years, a rapidly increasing number of expression profiling studies using isolated microglial cell populations have been reported. In these studies, the microglia transcriptome was compared to other cell types, such as other brain cells and peripheral tissue macrophages, and related to aging and neurodegenerative conditions. A commonality found in many of these studies was that microglia possess distinct gene expression signatures. This repertoire of selectively-expressed microglial genes highlight functions beyond immune responses, such as synaptic modulation and neurotrophic support, and open up avenues to explore as-yet-unexpected roles. These data provide improved understanding of disease pathology, and complement not only the aforementioned whole brain tissue transcriptome studies, but also genome- and epigenome-wide association studies. In this review, insights obtained from isolated microglia transcriptome studies are presented, and compared to studies using other genome-wide approaches. The relation of microglia to other tissue macrophages and glial cell populations, as well as the role of microglia in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative conditions, will be discussed. Many more of these types of studies are expected in the near future, hopefully leading to the identification of novel genes and targets for neurodegenerative conditions.Keywords: Alzheimer's disease; aging; amyotrophic lateral sclerosisl epigenetics; gene expression.	全基因组表达谱分析技术已为各种组织，状况和疾病提供了详细的转录组数据。在神经科学中，表达数据集主要使用整个脑组织样本生成，产生的数据来自包括胶质细胞和神经元在内的多种细胞类型。在过去的几年中，已经报道了使用分离的小胶质细胞群体的表达谱研究的数量迅速增加。在这些研究中，将小胶质细胞转录组与其他细胞类型（例如其他脑细胞和周围组织巨噬细胞）进行了比较，并与衰老和神经退行性疾病有关。在许多这些研究中发现的共同点是小胶质细胞具有独特的基因表达特征。选择性表达的小胶质细胞基因的这一功能库突出了免疫反应以外的功能，例如突触调节和神经营养支持，并开辟了途径来探索迄今未曾预料到的作用。这些数据提供了对疾病病理学的更好理解，不仅补充了上述全脑组织转录组研究，而且补充了全基因组和表观基因组范围的关联研究。在这篇综述中，将介绍从孤立的小胶质细胞转录组研究中获得的见解，并将其与使用其他全基因组方法的研究进行比较。将讨论小胶质细胞与其他组织巨噬细胞和神经胶质细胞群体的关系，以及小胶质细胞在衰老的大脑和神经退行性疾病中的作用。这些类型的研究有望在不久的将来进行更多的研究，希望能鉴定出神经退行性疾病的新基因和靶标。老化;肌萎缩性侧索硬化症的表观遗传学；基因表达。
29595720	5000 Free Flaps and Counting: A 10-Year Review of a Single Academic Institution's Microsurgical Development and Outcomes	Background: The establishment of an effective clinical and academic culture within an institution is a multifactorial process. This process is cultivated by dynamic elements such as recruitment of an accomplished and diverse faculty, patient geographic outreach, clinical outcomes research, and fundamental support from all levels of an institution. This study reviews the academic evolution of a single academic plastic surgery practice, and summarizes a 10-year experience of microsurgical development, clinical outcomes, and academic productivity.Methods: A 10-year retrospective institutional review was performed from fiscal years 2006 to 2016. Microsurgical flap type and operative volume were measured across all microsurgery faculty and participating hospitals. Microvascular compromise and flap salvage rates were noted for the six highest volume surgeons. Univariate and multivariable predictors of flap salvage were determined.Results: The 5000th flap was performed in December of 2015 within this institutional study period. Looking at the six highest volume surgeons, free flaps were examined for microvascular compromise, with an institutional mean take-back rate of 1.53 percent and flap loss rate of 0.55 percent across all participating hospitals. Overall, 74.4 percent of cases were breast flaps, and the remaining cases were extremity and head and neck flaps.Conclusions: Focused faculty and trainee recruitment has resulted in an academically and clinically productive practice. Collaboration among faculty, staff, and residents contributes to continual learning, innovation, and quality patient care. This established framework, constructed based on experience, offers a workable and reproducible model for other academic plastic surgery institutions.Clinical question/level of evidence: Therapeutic, IV.	背景：在机构内建立有效的临床和学术文化是一个多因素过程。这个过程是由动态因素培育的，例如招聘一个熟练而多样的教职人员，患者地域拓展，临床结果研究以及机构各个层面的基本支持。这项研究回顾了单一学术整形外科实践的学术发展，并总结了10年的显微外科手术发展，临床结局和学术生产力的方法。方法：从2006财年至2016财年进行了为期10年的回顾性机构审查。在所有显微外科学院和参与医院中均测量了显微外科瓣的类型和手术量。六个最高容量的外科医生注意到微血管损伤和皮瓣抢救率。结果：确定了2015年12月在该机构研究期内进行的第5000次皮瓣修复。在六名最高容量的外科医生中，检查了所有游离医院皮瓣的微血管损伤情况，机构平均回收率为1.53％，皮瓣丢失率为0.55％。总体而言，有74.4％的病例是乳腺皮瓣，其余病例是四肢和头颈部皮瓣。结论：集中的教职员工和实习生已经产生了学术和临床上的生产实践。教师，员工和居民之间的协作有助于不断学习，创新和优质的患者护理。基于经验建立的已建立框架为其他学术整形外科机构提供了可行且可复制的模型。临床问题/证据级别：Therapeutic，IV。
28085514	A Sustainable Model for Patient follow-up following an International Cleft Mission: A Proof of Concept	Purpose: Patient follow-up after cleft missions is imperative if we are to critically assess the quality of care provided in these settings. The adoption of mobile telephones among disadvantaged families abroad may enable such an undertaking in a cost-effective manner. This project aimed to assess the efficacy of cellular phone-based follow-up in a developing country following a cleft mission to Thailand.Methods: Changing Children's Lives Inc. performed a cleft surgical mission to Udon Thani, Thailand, in January 2013. Telephone numbers collected at that time were used to survey the patients or their parents 1.5 years postoperatively.Results: Of the 56 patients who underwent cleft lip and/or palate surgery during the mission, more than 50% ( n = 30, 54%) were reachable by telephone; all chose to participate in the study. The cost for families was U.S. $124.92 (56.15); 26 families (87%) believed their money was well spent. Follow-up care was received by 22 (73%) patients, and all but one family ( n = 29, 97%) felt that their child received all of the medical care and support required. All families ( N = 30) would recommend similar cleft care to a friend. Of the patients younger than 18 years of age ( n = 24, 80%), 20 (80%) families found their child more comfortable interacting with peers, more comfortable interacting with adults, and more confident postoperatively.Conclusion: In one month, a survey response rate of more than 50% was obtained by leveraging the increased adoption of mobile phones in rural settings. Nearly all patients/families treated during the cleft mission were satisfied with the care that they received.Keywords: cleft; cleft lip; cleft palate; medical mission; patient satisfaction; surgical mission.	目的：如果要严格评估这些环境中提供的护理质量，则必须对裂隙任务后的患者进行随访。在国外的处境不利家庭中使用移动电话可以以具有成本效益的方式实现这一目标。该项目旨在评估在对泰国进行一次裂口手术后发展中国家基于手机进行的随访的有效性。方法：2013年1月，Changed Children's Lives Inc.对泰国乌隆他尼进行了一次裂口手术。电话号码结果：在术后1.5年对患者或其父母进行调查。结果：在任务期间接受唇left裂和/或pa裂手术的56例患者中，可以达到50％以上（n = 30、54％）通过电话;所有人都选择参加研究。家庭费用为124.92美元（56.15）； 26个家庭（87％）认为他们的钱用得其所。 22位患者（73％）接受了后续护理，除一个家庭外（n = 29，97％），其他所有家庭都认为他们的孩子获得了所需的所有医疗和支持。所有家庭（N = 30）都会向朋友推荐类似的裂口护理。在18岁以下的患者中（n = 24，80％），有20个（80％）家庭发现他们的孩子与同龄人互动更舒适，与成人互动更舒适，并且术后更有信心。结论：在一个月内，通过利用农村地区越来越多的移动电话，获得了超过50％的调查答复率。 c裂任务期间接受治疗的几乎所有患者/家属都对他们所接受的护理感到满意。唇裂left裂医疗任务；患者满意度；手术任务。
29748706	Evaluation of parental and surgeon stressors and perceptions of distraction osteogenesis in pediatric craniofacial patients: a cross-sectional survey study	Purpose: There is a paucity of literature on how limitations of distraction osteogenesis (DO) are perceived by physicians and parents of pediatric patients. Specifically understanding which features of DO are most concerning to these two groups may better inform parent education, as well as direct improvements in distraction protocols and devices.Method: Parents/guardians of patients (between January 2016 and October 2017) being treated with craniofacial distraction were recruited to complete a survey regarding level of stress (1 = not stressful, 9 = maximally stressful) associated with eight features of DO. Craniofacial surgeons completed a survey asking them to report (1) their personal level of stress and (2) their perceptions of parental stress regarding these same eight features of DO.Results: Thirty-five parents and 15 craniofacial surgeons completed the survey. The risk of the device getting infected was perceived as most stressful by parents (5.5 ± 2.3) followed by the device sticking through the skin (4.9 ± 2.6) and the second operation for removal (4.7 ± 2.3). These same three features also elicited the highest level of stress among surgeons. Surgeon-perceived parental stress regarding turning of the distractor (5.8 ± 1.5) was significantly higher than parent self-reported stress (4.2 ± 2.8, p = 0.042).Conclusions: Both parents and surgeons perceive risk of device-associated infection, the protrusion of the device through the skin, and the requirement of a second operation for removal as the most stressful drawbacks of distraction. Infection reduction protocols, less obtrusive devices, and devices that do not require removal are potential targets for stress reduction.Keywords: Craniosynostosis; Device; Infection; Surgery.	目的：缺乏文献说明儿科患者的医师和家长如何认识到分心成骨（DO）的局限性。明确了解DO这两个群体最关注的特征可能会更好地指导父母的教育，以及分心方案和设备的直接改善。方法：正在接受颅面分心治疗的患者的父母/监护人（2016年1月至2017年10月之间）招募人员完成与DO的八个特征相关的压力水平（1 =无压力，9 =最大压力）的调查。颅面外科医师完成了一项调查，要求他们报告（1）他们对个人压力的这8个特征的个人压力水平和（2）他们对父母压力的看法。结果：35名父母和15名颅面外科医师完成了调查。父母认为该设备受到感染的风险最大（5.5±2.3），其次该设备粘在皮肤上（4.9±2.6），并且进行了第二次移除操作（4.7±2.3）。这三个特征也引起了外科医生的最高压力。外科医生对分心器转动的感觉到的父母压力（5.8±1.5）明显高于父母自己报告的压力（4.2±2.8，p = 0.042）。通过皮肤的装置的拆卸，以及第二次去除操作的要求，这是分散注意力的最大压力。减少感染的方案，不易引人注目的器械以及不需要移除的器械是减轻压力的潜在目标。设备;感染;手术。
31033762	A Craniometric Analysis of the Posterior Cranial Base After Posterior Vault Distraction	Background: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) has been demonstrated to effectively increase intracranial volume, treat increased intracranial pressure, and improve head shape in syndromic patients. The purpose of this study is to compare changes along the posterior cranial base before and after distraction.Methods: A retrospective review was completed of subjects who underwent PVDO with computed tomography scans at 2 time-points: within 3 months preoperatively and 1 to 6 months postoperatively. Using Mimics software, craniometric landmarks were identified and surface area of the foramen magnum was calculated. A comparison of pre- to postoperative measurements was completed using Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank tests and linear regression.Results: A total of 65 PVDO subjects were identified, 12 subjects met inclusion criteria. Mean operative age was 3.0 ± 4.0 years. The cranial vault was distracted on average 25.0 ± 6.0 mm, with those < 12 months of age distracted 29.5 ± 4.9 mm and >12 months of age distracted 22.0 ± 4.9 mm (P = 0.0543). There was a significant increase in pre- to postoperative foramen magnum surface area (52.1 ± 63.2 mm, P = 0.002), length (0.9 ± 1.4 mm, P = 0.050), and width (0.6 ± 1.0 mm, P = 0.050). Similarly, linear distances between nasion and posterior cranial base landmarks such as foramen magnum (3.4 ± 4.2 mm, P = 0.010), and occipital protuberance (9.1 ± 9.6 mm, P = 0.003) were increased. Subjects under 12 months had a greater percentage increases in posterior vault length than those over 12 months.Conclusion: Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis is associated with an increase in size of the foramen magnum, and lengthening of the posterior cranial base, both of which may be beneficial in patients with turribrachycephaly.	背景：已证明后穹dis牵引成骨术（PVDO）可有效增加颅内体积，治疗颅内压升高，并改善综合征患者的头部形状。本研究的目的是比较分心前后颅后基底的变化。方法：对在两个时间点进行PVDO并接受计算机断层扫描的受试者进行回顾性审查：术前3个月内和术前1至6个月术后。使用Mimics软件，确定颅骨标志物，并计算大孔的表面积。使用Wilcoxon配对配对有序秩检验和线性回归完成了术前与术后测量的比较。结果：总共确定了65名PVDO受试者，其中12名受试者符合纳入标准。平均手术年龄为3.0±4.0岁。颅穹顶平均分散25.0±6.0毫米，<12个月大者分散29.5±4.9毫米，大于12个月大者分散22.0±4.9毫米（P = 0.0543）。术前至术后大孔最大表面积（52.1±63.2 mm，P = 0.002），长度（0.9±1.4 mm，P = 0.050）和宽度（0.6±1.0 mm，P = 0.050）有显着增加。同样，鼻孔和后颅底标志物（如大孔）（3.4±4.2 mm，P = 0.010）和枕骨隆起（9.1±9.6 mm，P = 0.003）之间的线性距离增加。 12个月以下的受试者的后穹length长度增加的百分比大于12个月以上的受试者。对头颅头颅病患者有益。
28445231	The Effects of Multi-Day vs. Single Pre-exercise Nitrate Supplement Dosing on Simulated Cycling Time Trial Performance and Skeletal Muscle Oxygenation	Jo, E, Fischer, M, Auslander, AT, Beigarten, A, Daggy, B, Hansen, K, Kessler, L, Osmond, A, Wang, H, and Wes, R. The effects of multiday vs. single pre-exercise nitrate supplement dosing on simulated cycling time trial performance and skeletal muscle oxygenation. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 217-224, 2019-A transient augmentation in the metabolic efficiency of skeletal muscle is the purported basis for dietary nitrate supplementation amongst competitive and recreational athletes alike. Previous studies support the ergogenic effects of nitrate supplementation, as findings indicated improved microvascular blood flow, exercise economy, and performance with relatively short-term supplementation. As with most ergogenic aids, the optimum duration of supplementation before performance or competition, i.e., loading phase, is a critical determinant for efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term vs. single dosing nitrate supplementation on skeletal muscle oxygenation and cycling performance. In a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, parallel design study, healthy, recreationally active men (n = 15) and women (n = 14) subjects (age = 18-29 years) completed an 8 km (5 mi) simulated cycling time trial before and after a 14-day supplementation period with either a nitrate supplement (Multi-Day Dosing Group) (n = 14) or placebo (Single Pre-Exercise Dosing Group; SD) (n = 15). Both groups consumed a single dose of the nitrate supplement 2 hours before the post-treatment time trial. In addition, skeletal muscle oxygenation was measured via near-infrared spectroscopy during each time trial. Multiday nitrate supplementation significantly decreased time to completion (p = 0.01) and increased average power (p = 0.04) and speed (p = 0.02) from pre-to post-treatment, while a single dosing produced no significant changes to these measures. There were no significant differences over time and across treatments for any other measures including muscle oxygenation variables. Overall, long-term nitrate supplementation appears to have an advantage over a single pre-exercise dosing on cycling performance and metabolic efficiency as indicated by an increase in power output with no change in oxygenation.
